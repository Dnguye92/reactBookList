What Are Reducers?
	- is a function that returns a piece of the application state
	- creating a reducer is a 2-step process
		- creating the reducer
		- wiring it into our application so that it is available from any file
	- you can import the reducer like you would a custom component
	- by passing our reducer as a value of state inside of our combineReducer function we are telling redux how to create our app state
	- we must connect our React views and Redux state to make a useable application
	- we must use the ReactRedux library to merge the two together
	- we're going to change one of our components into a container
		- a container is a react component that has a direct connection to the state managed by Redux

How can we tell which components we need to promote to containers?
	- in general we want to change the most parent component into a container
	- we are going to make BookList and BookDetail containers
	- whenever we forge a connection between a component and Redux we are turning that component into a container or smart component
	- pulling the connect property from the react-redux library. This will help us forge the connection
